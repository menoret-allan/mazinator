# Maze generator (mostly to play with property testing on an existing algorythm that need changes)

The blazor app is deploy on [my personal website](https://maze.allanmenoret.com/)

[WIKI for maze generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm)

I play around to generate a perfect maze with a random algo.

Then I created some "property tests" to verify that mazes were correct.

Then I implemented a new algo. Since the maze is still perfect I could apply the property tests to it (which was the whole point of this little experiment ðŸ™‚).
